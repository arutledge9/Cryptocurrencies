# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary

I've been working with my friend Martha in the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting to help the company offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. To assist the company, Martha and I have used unsupervised learning models to include which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, as well as how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment. We preprocessed the data, reduced the data dimensions/features with PCA, clustered our cryptocurrencies using the K-Means Algorithm, and finally visualized our results to be able to present our finding to the Accountability Accounting team.
